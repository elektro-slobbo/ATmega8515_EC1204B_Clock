# ATmega8515_EC1204B_Clock

Some weeks ago I get in contact with the circuit board EC1204B.
It's a small pcb with 4 lcd 7-segments and 60 led's arranged in a circuit like a clock.
Original equip with a 'AT89S52' (compatible with 80C51 instruction set and pinout) I want
to reprogram the PCB with my AVR stuff. So I find a (nearly) compatible pinout ÂµC: ATmega8515.

Many thanks to Cristian COPCEA who started a nearly same project in 2015.
He programmed first a 'AT90S8515' and also switched to 'ATmega8515'. 
He described his experiences and the small hardware changes necessary 
for using the ATmega8515 with the EC1204B board in a wide documentation.
This was the base and my entry point. (His lastest version I used to start my project was the 'EC1204B-10.zip')

The two main points for reprogramming the clock was to
- add the possibility to show the number of days to a particular date
  (to show my nephew the number of days until he is 18 :-)

- add a nerf gun detector to stop the alarm clock
  (like seen in this example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2WAyDod0W4)
  
  I also convert it to a Atmel Studio 7.0 project.
  By the way, I notice that the Hex-file of Studio 7 was smaller then build with WinAVR, etc.
  That was very important for me, cause the current hex-file has nearly a size of 99% of the 
  ATmega8515 flash. If you need more flash size, have a look at the ATmega162. It's a pin compatible
  type which has 16K bytes programmable flash. 
  
  See the documentation folder for the operation manual of the clock

  If you are interessted in the current source code please write email to me 
  and feel free to improve the code and let me know!
  
 Update 2020:
- Time switches after 10 sec now. Other items after a shorter time.
